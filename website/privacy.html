                    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
                    <p>All data you create in Tap Tap Track is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> using Apple's SwiftData framework. This includes:</p>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Event presets and their configurations</li>
                        <li>Location data (if you enable location logging): GPS coordinates, business names, and addresses - all stored locally on your device</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This data:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Remains on your device at all times</li>

                        <li>Can be exported by you at any time via the CSV export feature</li>

                    <h2>Optional Location Logging</h2>
                    <div class="policy-box">
                        <h4>Location logging is completely optional and disabled by default.</h4>
                        <p>Tap Tap Track includes an optional location logging feature that you can enable per category. This feature allows the app to automatically capture GPS coordinates and nearby business names when you track events in location-enabled categories.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>IMPORTANT: Location data is ONLY sent to Apple's servers.</strong></p>
                        <p>When location logging is enabled, the app uses Apple's MapKit service to search for nearby business and location names. <strong>Tap Tap Track does not collect, store, or have access to any location data.</strong> The only location data transmission that occurs is an anonymized call directly from your device to Apple's servers to fetch business names based on your coordinates.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>You control it:</strong> Location logging must be explicitly enabled for each category. It is disabled by default for all categories.</li>
                            <li><strong>Your data stays private:</strong> All tracked events, location names, coordinates, and notes are stored locally on your device and never sent to Tap Tap Track's servers or any third-party servers.</li>
                            <li><strong>Only Apple receives location data:</strong> When location logging is enabled and you track an event, the app makes an anonymized call to Apple's MapKit servers to search for nearby businesses. Only your current GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) are sent to Apple's servers for this business name search. This data is sent anonymously with no personal identifiers and is subject to <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
                            <li><strong>Tap Tap Track does not collect location data:</strong> We do not collect, store, or have access to any location data. The location data is only used locally on your device and sent directly to Apple's servers for business name lookup. We never see, collect, or store this information.</li>
                            <li><strong>No personal information:</strong> Only anonymous coordinates are sent to Apple. No personal information, device identifiers, or any other data is transmitted.</li>
                            <li><strong>You can disable it anytime:</strong> You can disable location logging for any category at any time. Once disabled, no location data will be captured or sent.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>What data is sent to Apple (and only Apple):</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) - anonymous, no personal identifiers</li>
                            <li>Optional search query if you search for a specific business name</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>What data is NOT sent anywhere:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your name, email, or any personal information</li>
                            <li>Device identifiers or account information</li>
                            <li>The events you track or any notes you write</li>
                            <li>Your location history or patterns</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Tap Tap Track's commitment:</strong> We do not collect, store, or have access to any location data. Location data is only sent to Apple's servers for the purpose of fetching business and location names, and this data is not collected by anyone at Tap Tap Track or made available in any way aside from the anonymized call to Apple's servers. Tap Tap Track doesn't collect or send location data anywhere else.</p>

These requests are limited to fetching business names based on your coordinates. No other network requests are made, and all your personal data remains on your device.</p>
